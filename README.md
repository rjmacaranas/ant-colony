## Updates <a name="updates"></a>
- May 11, 2020: Began implementation of A-star search path finding in order
to better understand the MATLAB environment. Hoping to complete this by
tomorrow in order to duplicate findings in "Research on Robot Path Planning
Based on Dijkstra and Ant Colony Optimization" by Nie and Zhao (2019).
