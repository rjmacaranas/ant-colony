## Updates <a name="updates"></a>
- May 12, 2020: Continued implementation of A-star search, but could not finish
applying the algorithm to the simpleMap object in exampleMaps.mat. The task of
completing this is again pushed to tomorrow. Admittedly did not have much time
to work today, but tomorrow should be better.


- May 11, 2020: Began implementation of A-star search path finding in order
to better understand the MATLAB environment. Hoping to complete this by
tomorrow in order to duplicate findings in "Research on Robot Path Planning
Based on Dijkstra and Ant Colony Optimization" by Nie and Zhao (2019) by
Thursday May 14.
