## Updates <a name="updates"></a>
- May 14, 2020: Completed A-star search algorithm application to simpleMap.
Also created a flowchart for the A-star search of a 2D map which is included
in the images folder. Made a project_code directory to include the completed
A-star search that can be used for project results. Need to figure out how
to measure the performance of the algorithm. Should be able to move onto
implementing the Dijkstra-ACO algorithm by this weekend.

- May 12, 2020: Continued implementation of A-star search, but could not finish
applying the algorithm to the simpleMap object in exampleMaps.mat. The task of
completing this is again pushed to tomorrow. Admittedly did not have much time
to work today, but tomorrow should be better.


- May 11, 2020: Began implementation of A-star search path finding in order
to better understand the MATLAB environment. Hoping to complete this by
tomorrow in order to duplicate findings in "Research on Robot Path Planning
Based on Dijkstra and Ant Colony Optimization" by Nie and Zhao (2019) by
Thursday May 14.
